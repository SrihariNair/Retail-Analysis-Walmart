# Online E-commerce Store Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing sales data from an online e-commerce store using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and product trends to inform business decisions. The analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization through pivot tables, charts, dashboards, and slicers.

## Steps Involved
### Data Cleaning
- Imported raw sales data into Excel.
- Removed duplicates to ensure data accuracy.
- Corrected inconsistencies and filled missing values.
- Standardized formats (e.g., dates, currency) for consistency.
- Used functions like TRIM to clean text fields and ensure uniformity.

### Data Transformation
- Added calculated columns for additional metrics (e.g., total sales amount, average order value).
- Categorized data into relevant buckets (e.g., age groups, order status).
- Used functions such as SUMIFS, IF, and TEXT to enrich and manipulate data.
- Employed TRIM to remove leading/trailing spaces from text data.

### Creating Pivot Tables
- Created pivot tables to summarize and analyze data:
- Sales performance by month, category, and region.
- Customer demographics and purchasing patterns.
- Product performance and inventory levels.
- Applied filters and slicers to pivot tables for interactive analysis.

### Data Visualization
- Developed charts to visualize key metrics:
- Sales trends over time (line charts).
- Product category performance (bar charts).
- Customer demographics (pie charts).
- Integrated pivot charts with pivot tables for dynamic updates.

### Dashboards and Slicers
- Designed interactive dashboards to present insights:
- Sales performance dashboard with key KPIs.
- Customer insights dashboard highlighting demographics and repeat purchases.
- Product performance dashboard showcasing top-selling items.
- Implemented slicers for easy data filtering and exploration.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: Primary tool for data analysis, pivot tables, and visualization.
- Excel Functions: SUMIFS, IF, TEXT, TRIM, REMOVE DUPLICATES for data transformation and cleaning.
- Pivot Tables & Charts: For summarizing and visualizing data insights.
- Slicers: For interactive data filtering in dashboards.

### How to Use
- Download the Excel workbook from the repository.
- Open the workbook in Microsoft Excel.
- Explore the different sheets for data, pivot tables, and dashboards.
- Use slicers and filters to interact with the data and customize the analysis as needed.
